<!--I used ChatGpt help for the script, I missed in class yesterday so I was a bit lost. Hope that this is the actions that you were looking for.
I like the idea of using the buttons and actually getting a response from them, I wonder if animaiton is soon to be possible from us in something like this!!-->
<button onclick="hideJohn()">Click Here to See a Photo of John Kelly</button>

<h1>This is John Kelly's Website - Enjoy Yourself</h1>

<button onclick="showMessage()">Click me to see the date</button>

<script>
  function showMessage() {
    alert("No you're not cool enough");
  }

  function hideJohn() {
    alert("John Kelly does not want to be seen");
  }
