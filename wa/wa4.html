    <h2><u>History</u></h2>
    <section>
    <p>After leaving his position as head chef at the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_Hotel"> Plaza Hotel</a> in New York City, <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore_Boiardi"> Ettore Boiardi</a> opened a restaurant called Il Giardino d'Italia ("The Garden of Italy") in 1924[3] at East 9th Street and Woodland Avenue in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland"> Cleveland</a>, Ohio.[4] The idea for Chef Boiardi came about when restaurant customers began asking Boiardi for his spaghetti sauce, which he began to distribute in milk bottles.[3] Four years later, in 1928, Boiardi opened a factory and moved production to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton,_Pennsylvania"> Milton, Pennsylvania</a>, where he could grow his own tomatoes and mushrooms.[2] He decided to anglicize the name of his product to "Boy-Ar-Dee" to help Americans pronounce his name correctly.[3] The first product to be sold was a "ready-to-heat spaghetti kit" in 1928. The kit included uncooked pasta, tomato sauce, and a container of pre-grated cheese.[5]

    The U.S. military commissioned the company during <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"> World War II</a> for the production of army rations, requiring the factory to run 24 hours a day.[2] At its peak, the company employed approximately 5,000 workers and produced 250,000 cans per day. After the war ended, Boiardi had to choose between selling the company or laying off everyone he had hired. He sold the company to American Home Foods in 1946 for nearly $6 million, and remained as a spokesman and consultant for the brand until 1978.[6] American Home Foods turned its food division into <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Home_Foods"> International Home Foods</a> in 1996. Four years later, International Home Foods was purchased by <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conagra_Brands"> ConAgra Foods</a>, which continues to produce Chef Boyardee canned pastas bearing Boiardi's likeness.[7]

<h2><u>Advertising</u></h2>
<p>In 2018, Barbara Lippert of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_Age"> <i>Advertising Age</i></a> compared the 1966 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMLY%26R"> Young & Rubicam</a> ad for Beefaroni to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_400_Blows"> <i>The 400 Blows</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_of_the_bulls"> running of the bulls.</a> The ad features a large group of children running through Venice singing, "Hooray...for Beefaroni!" Lippert believed the ad influenced other famous commercials such as Prince Spaghetti (known for "Anthony! Anthony!") and "Hilltop" for Coca-Cola.[8]

    Chef Boyardee is one of the only brands to request to be removed from an episode of Seinfeld. In the 1996 episode "The Rye", Kramer is allowed to operate a Hansom cab for a week, and feeds the horse excess cans of Beefaroni, which causes frequent and foul smelling flatulence. As a result of the request, the name was changed to "Beef-a-reeno".[9]

    In 2005, Chef Boyardee was shown in MasterCard's "Icons" commercial during Super Bowl XXXIX, which depicts advertising mascots having dinner together.[10]
